            <p>I am a senior computer science major at UVM. I am from Massachusetts<br>
               and I have 2 cats named Louie and Oreo. I chose UVM because of the<br>
               forests and mountains around Burlington since I did a lot of camping<br>
               and hiking while growing up.</p>
