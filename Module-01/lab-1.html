            <!--Why I am in the class-->
            <p>In the past I have taken different classes that used webpages in the<br> 
                code, but I mostly did the functional parts of the projects while<br> 
                others did the html and stuff. So, I wanted to take the class so I<br>
                could get some practice actually doing the webdev side of the code.</p>

            <p>Some things that I enjoy doing outside of class are hiking and<br>
                camping. I have a goal of hiking all of the 4000ft mountains in<br>
                Vermont. I also enjoy playing games like Satisfactory and Helldivers.</p>
